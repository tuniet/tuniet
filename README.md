### 👨🏽‍💻 About me :

I'm a passionate software developer with a diverse learning journey. I started in IT college but found my true calling in hands-on coding experiences. I completed a full-stack web development bootcamp at 4GeeksAcademy, where I specialized in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).

Currently, I'm deepening my knowledge at 42 Madrid, an exclusive coding program by Fundación Telefónica, where I’m focusing on C and C++ for application development. This program challenges me to solve complex problems, improve my algorithmic thinking, and build efficient, low-level applications.
Tech Stack & Interests:

- 💻 Full-Stack: JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- ⚙️ Low-Level Programming: C, C++
- 🚀 Always Learning: System programming, algorithms, and software architecture

I love tackling new challenges, collaborating on exciting projects, and continuously improving my skills. Let's build something awesome together!
